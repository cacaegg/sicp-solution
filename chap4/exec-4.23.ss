; 1. Consider following expression:
; (lambda (n) n)
;
; For the Alyssa P. Hacker's version, it will evaluate n with environment,
; which if n is not a procedure, behavior will be undefined.
;
; However, in the text book's version, it will simply return n, which is 
; the expected behavior of this expression.
;
; 2. analyze-sequence is analyzed in run-time, if we need to modify algorithm.
; Remove, so., little endion.
